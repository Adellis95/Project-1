# Rick and Morty Adventure

We designed an application based on the Rick and Morty Television show. Once, the user clicks the start journey button on the website, the user is sent on journey to various worlds, where they are offered different life advice. In these different worlds there are various characters who have different advice on their cards. When the user flips the card, the advice from that character will be given to them. To pull the tip that will be displayed to the user, we used an API. The user is in for an adventure like no other!

Technologies : JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery

# Table of Contents 
1. Main Page
- This is the first page of the application 
- This page allows the user to start the journey by clicking the button.  
2. Second Page - Sixth Page
- Through out these pages are the the various worlds that the user are traveling through. 
- On these pages are different character cards that have advice on the back of their card. 
3. End Page/Story Page
- This is the seventh page of the application, that shows the end of the journey. This page gives the user a story to end the journey and gives the user an option to start the adventure over again.
