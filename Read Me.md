# Rick and Morty Adventure
We designed an application based on the Rick and Morty Television show. Once, the user clicks the start journey button on the website, the user is sent on  journey to various worlds, where they are offered different life advice. In these different  worlds there are various characters who have different advice on their cards. When the user flips the card, the advice from that character will be given to them. To pull the tip that will be displayed to the user, we used an API.

 Technologies : JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery
