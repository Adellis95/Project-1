# Rick and Morty Adventure

## Description

We designed an application based on the Rick and Morty Television show. Once, the user clicks the start journey button on the website, the user is sent on journey to various worlds, where they are offered different life advice. In these different worlds there are various characters who have different advice on their cards. When the user flips the card, the advice from that character will be given to them. To pull the tip that will be displayed to the user, we used an API. The user is in for an adventure like no other!
